# CAR WIPER SYSTEM

## Abstract

A wiper is used to clean car glass that has been exposed to dirt or moisture. Wipers are usually mounted to the front and back of the vehicle. The driver's view will not be obstructed by the wiper, allowing them to see clearly to the front and rear.Wiper performance is strongly tied to driving safety, wipers play a critical role in the safety of riders .When a driver's view is obstructed due to dewy formed by heavy rain, the likelihood of an accident increases dramatically. As a result, wipers are an essential feature that must be included on all cars.In the project **CAR WIPER SYSTEM** I have used STM32F407 Discovery board in which four leds gets lit in three different speed sequentially is resembled as a wiper and I have used the button for switching on the system (ignition of the system) and to switch between three modes of wiper and finally to switch off the system.The Red LED indicates the Car have been switched on;The Blue,Green and Orange LED works in sequence in three different speed to resemble the wiper in three switch presses ie)different speed for each switch press and fifth switch press indicates the wiper system to turn off and the final switch press indicates the car to switch off.

## Components

## Software Requirements:

- STM32CubeIDE:
       STM32CubeIDE is an all-in-one multi-OS development tool, which is part of the STM32Cube software ecosystem. STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors.
- QEMU:
      QEMU is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates the machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems.

## STM32F407VG
The STM32F407VG is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, up to 192 Kbytes of SRAM), up to 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer three 12-bit ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers including two PWM timers for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers. a true random number generator (RNG). They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.

## STM32F407-Discovery
The STM32F4DISCOVERY Discovery kit leverages the capabilities of the STM32F407 high-performance microcontrollers, to allow users to develop audio applications easily. It includes an ST-LINK/V2-A embedded debug tool, one ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, one digital microphone, one audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, push-buttons, and a USB OTG Micro-AB connector. STM32F4-Discovery kit photoSpecialized add-on boards can be connected by means of the extension header connectors.

## LED
A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a semiconductor device, which can emit light when an electric current passes through it. To do this, holes from p-type semiconductors recombine with electrons from n-type semiconductors to produce light.

## BUTTON

A Push Button switch is a type of switch which consists of a simple electric mechanism or air switch mechanism to turn something on or off. Depending on model they could operate with momentary or latching action function. The button itself is usually constructed of a strong durable material such as metal or plastic.
