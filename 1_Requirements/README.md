# Requirements

## Features

-   The idea is simple and is driven by the fact that dustbins require very frequent cleaning, which is not always possible. This leads to unhealthy environment and spread of diseases. The aim is to get the dustbin cleaned timely using alert services.
   
-   The project is titled as **WASTE LEVEL MONITORING** and developed using C language.
   
-   Atmega328p is the microcontroller used in this system.
   
-   Atmega328p is connected with LCD display to show the status of the dustbin and the distance filled,Ultrasonic sensor which helps in finding the distance filled by sending a signal through trigpin and receiving through echo pin and by using the time taken by the echo pin to recieve the signal the distance is calculated,Buzzer and LED is connected which acts as alert signals to indicate when the dustbin is full and the distance is also send through USART which is a communication protocol which could be seen in serial monitor.
   
-   In my Project the dustbin gives alert signal when the dustbin have distance to fill the wastes is about less than 6cm.

### Advantages
-  Cost efficient
-  Simple circuit
-  Simple program
-  Advantageous to environment

## Research

   Several models on Waste level Indicator are researched and this application is created on basis of the research
 
 Few research models are :

# 4 W's and 1 H

## Who
Make the public aware of Whether the dustbin is full and to use it accordingly.

## What
It's an Embedded system which helps in finding the distance of trash filled.

## When
Distance is measured continuously and the data is displayed and sent.

## Where
It can be incorporated in both domestic and public dustbins for indication of trash level.

## How
In my Project the dustbin gives alert signal when the dustbin have distance to fill the wastes is about less than 6cm.Atmega328p is the microcontroller used in this system and the language used as a software in this embedded system is C language further the Atmega328 is connected with LCD display to show the status of the dustbin and the distance filled,Ultrasonic sensor which helps in finding the distance filled by sending a signal through trigpin and receiving through echo pin and by using the time taken by the echo pin to recieve the signal the distance is calculated,Buzzer and LED is connected which acts as alert signals to indicate when the dustbin is full and the distance is also send through USART which is a communication protocol which could be seen in serial monitor.

## BEST METHOD FOLLOWED

C programming is one of the less complex language through which this application is done.In my Project the dustbin gives alert signal when the dustbin have distance to fill the wastes is about less than 6cm.The idea is simple and is driven by the fact that dustbins require very frequent cleaning, which is not always possible. This leads to unhealthy environment and spread of diseases. The aim is to get the dustbin cleaned timely using alert services.
