# CAR WIPER SYSTEM

## Abstract

A wiper is used to clean car glass that has been exposed to dirt or moisture. Wipers are usually mounted to the front and back of the vehicle. The driver's view will not be obstructed by the wiper, allowing them to see clearly to the front and rear.Wiper performance is strongly tied to driving safety, wipers play a critical role in the safety of riders .When a driver's view is obstructed due to dewy formed by heavy rain, the likelihood of an accident increases dramatically. As a result, wipers are an essentialÂ feature that must be included on all cars.In the project **CAR WIPER SYSTEM** I have used STM32F407 Discovery board in which four leds gets lit in three different speed sequentially is resembled as a wiper and I have used the button for switching on the system (ignition of the system) and to switch between three modes of wiper and finally to switch off the system.The Red LED indicates the Car have been switched on;The Blue,Green and Orange LED works in sequence in three different speed to resemble the wiper in three switch presses ie)different speed for each switch press and fifth switch press indicates the wiper system to turn off and the final switch press indicates the car to switch off.
